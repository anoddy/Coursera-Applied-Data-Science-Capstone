1. Which site has the largest successful launches? 
2. Which site has the highest launch success rate?
3. Which payload range(s) has the highest launch success rate?
4. Which payload range(s) has the lowest launch success rate?
5. Which F9 Booster version (`v1.0`, `v1.1`, `FT`, `B4`, `B5`, etc.) has the highest  
    launch success rate?

Answers

1. KSC LC-39A
2. i. CCAF LC-40 = 7/25   ii.  VAFB SLC-4E = 2/7 iii. KSC LC-39A = 10/13 iv. CCAFS SLC-40 = 3/7
3. A full numerical analysis would be required to confirm this trend precisely, but visual inspection suggests that the 2000â€“4000 kg payload range had a very high success rate
4. "Visually, the payload range between 6000 kg and 8000 kg appears to have the lowest launch success rate, as most launches in this range were unsuccessful (class = 0)."
5. FT
